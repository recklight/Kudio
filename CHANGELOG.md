## [3.3.0] - 2026-08-15

Two things a recording can be asked about without anything to compare it to:
**how loud does this sound**, and **is this usable at all**. Neither had an
answer in kudio before — `normalize` scales by the peak sample, and every
quality metric needs the clean signal beside the degraded one.

### Added
- **`loudness(y, sr)`** — gated integrated loudness to **ITU-R BS.1770-4**, in
  LUFS. `normalize` and `normalize_db` scale by the *peak* sample, which says
  nothing about how loud something sounds: a clip with one stray transient
  peak-normalises to a whisper. Nothing in kudio could answer "how loud is this
  to a listener" until now.
- **`normalize_lufs(y, sr, lufs=-23.0)`** — normalise to a loudness target
  (-23 LUFS is EBU R 128). Logs a warning rather than silently limiting when
  the gain would push the signal past full scale.
- **`match_loudness(y, reference, sr, reference_sr=None)`** — scale one clip to
  another's loudness. **An A/B comparison is not valid until this has been
  done**: of two versions of a clip, the louder is reliably preferred whatever
  its quality, so an unmatched comparison partly measures level. Handles the
  two sides being at different sample rates, since loudness is a property of
  the sound rather than of the sampling.

The standard publishes its K-weighting coefficients at 48 kHz only, and the
textbook shelf/high-pass equations do not reproduce them. The filters are
instead carried to the s-plane and re-discretised at the requested rate through
a prewarped bilinear transform: exact at 48 kHz by construction, within
0.06 dB of the reference curve at 16 kHz and 0.21 dB at 8 kHz. Cross-checked
against `pyloudnorm` — worst disagreement 0.043 LU across 8/16/44.1/48 kHz —
by a test that runs whenever that package happens to be installed. It is **not**
a dependency; this is numpy and scipy only.

- **`audio_report(y, sr)` → `AudioReport`** — the measurements you can make
  with **no clean reference**. Every existing metric (SNR, SI-SDR, PESQ, STOI)
  needs the clean signal next to the degraded one; synthetic datasets have
  that, real recordings never do. Reports level, true clipping, DC offset,
  silence ratio, noise floor, an SNR estimate and the bandwidth the content
  really occupies, plus `.problems()` — the findings in plain words.

  Two details worth knowing. **Clipping is a flat top, not a big number**:
  float audio amplified past 1.0 still traces its waveform and has lost
  nothing, so it gets a separate, weaker warning than a run of samples pinned
  at the rail. And **band-limit detection catches upsampled files** — a clip
  labelled 16 kHz whose content stops at 3.8 kHz is 8 kHz audio wearing a
  bigger number, which quietly wastes half a dataset. Audio recorded at its
  stated rate has a noise floor spanning the whole band and reaches Nyquist;
  upsampled audio has nothing above the old one.

### Fixed
- **`file_load(mono=False)` returned two different channel layouts.** The
  `sr=None` branch reads through soundfile and gave `(frames, channels)`; the
  resampling branch goes through librosa and gave `(channels, frames)`. The
  layout therefore depended on whether you happened to ask for a resample, and
  nothing said so. Both now return **channels last**, matching soundfile and
  what `loudness()` expects.

  Mono loading — the default, and almost all use — is unaffected. If you were
  loading multi-channel audio *with* an explicit `sr`, you were getting
  `(channels, frames)` and will now get its transpose.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-08-06

Building two packages on top of kudio surfaced a set of helpers that each of
them had written for itself. Every one of them is a place where two components
have to agree — on STFT geometry, on a sample rate, on normalisation
statistics — and where, until now, they agreed only by convention.

### Added
- **`STFT`** — the STFT settings as an immutable value, with `forward()` /
  `inverse()` / `n_bins` / `n_frames()` / `frame_times()` / `to_dict()`. A
  spectrogram and the waveform reconstructed from it must share `n_fft`,
  `hop_length`, `win_length` and `window`; passing those four to two separate
  functions and keeping them aligned by hand is how a producer and a consumer
  drift apart. `to_dict()` is meant to be stored next to a checkpoint, so a
  model and the geometry it was trained on travel together.
- **`Standardizer`** — per-column mean/std with `fit`/`transform`/`inverse`
  and `save`/`load`. Normalisation statistics are as much a part of a trained
  model as its weights; a model reloaded without them produces confident
  nonsense.
- **`stack_context(frames, context, pad=)`** — context-frame stacking for *any*
  feature matrix. The logic already existed but was fused into
  `waveform_to_spectrogram(forward_backward=)`, out of reach for MFCC or mel
  features. That path now delegates here, so there is one implementation.
- **`frame_windows(frames, n_frames, pad=)`** — cut a feature matrix into
  fixed-length windows, tail padded rather than dropped.
- **`normalize(y, peak=)` / `normalize_db(y, dbfs=)`** — peak normalisation
  with the divide-by-zero guard built in.
- **`resample(y, orig_sr, target_sr)`** — the in-memory counterpart of
  `file_load(..., sr=)`, which could only resample on the way in from disk.
  A no-op when the rates already match, so it is safe to call unconditionally.

### Fixed
- **`win_length` no longer defaults to a hard-coded 512.** It follows `n_fft`,
  the librosa convention. `waveform_to_spectrogram(y, n_fft=256)` previously
  raised `ParameterError: Target size (256) must be at least input size (512)`
  — a non-default FFT size simply did not work without also passing
  `win_length`. Applies to `waveform_to_spectrogram`,
  `spectrogram_to_waveform`, `file_to_spectrogram`, `logspec_from_files` and
  `save_spectrogram_as_wave`.

### Changed
- Following from that fix, `n_fft` **above** 512 with no explicit `win_length`
  now uses a window of `n_fft` rather than a 512-sample window zero-padded to
  `n_fft`. Results change for those calls. Pass `win_length=512` to keep the
  old behaviour.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-06

> Never released to PyPI on its own — these changes ship as part of 3.2.0.
> Kept as a separate section because they are a distinct set of fixes.

### Fixed
- **`Synthesizer` no longer resamples every mixture to 16 kHz.** The output
  rate came from a hard-coded fallback, so an 8 kHz corpus silently produced
  16 kHz mixtures — the dataset on disk disagreed with its source, and any
  model trained at the source rate then refused the files it was meant to
  consume. The default now keeps each clean file's own rate.
- **Noise is resampled to match its clean partner.** Previously both sides were
  loaded at the same fixed rate, which hid the problem; with a rate-preserving
  default, a noise file recorded at a different rate would otherwise have been
  mixed in as-is.

### Added
- `list_devices(kind=None)` — devices as **sounddevice** sees them, which is the
  index space `record(device=…)` accepts. `CheckDevice` enumerates through
  PyAudio for the streaming classes, and the two bindings number devices
  independently: an index from one was never valid in the other, and nothing
  said so. `kudio devices` now prints both spaces, labelled.
- `melspectrogram()` accepts a **waveform array** as well as a path (arrays
  need `sr=`), matching `mfcc(y, sr)`. Previously it was file-only, which
  forced a round-trip through disk for in-memory audio.
- `check_metrics_install()` is exported from the top level; it reports which of
  PESQ / STOI / SDR are installed and was already the documented way to degrade
  gracefully, but callers had to reach into `kudio.core.evaluator` for it.

### Changed
- `Synthesizer.syn(desired_sample=…)` is renamed **`target_sr`**. The old name
  read like a sample *count* — `kudio.core.feature` uses `desired_samples` for
  exactly that — while it actually meant a sample *rate*. `desired_sample` still
  works and emits a `DeprecationWarning`.

### Migration
Nothing to do if your audio was already 16 kHz. To keep the old behaviour on a
corpus at another rate, ask for it explicitly:

```python
syx.syn(mode="inc", target_sr=16000)
```

## [3.0.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Packaging: removed `pysepm` from the `[eval]` extra. `pysepm` is not
  published on PyPI, so `pip install kudio[eval]` / `kudio[all]` failed to
  resolve. PESQ is now documented as an optional manual install
  (`pip install https://github.com/schmiph2/pysepm/archive/master.zip`);
  `[eval]` keeps `mir_eval` + `pystoi` (STOI/SDR), which the code already
  degrades around when PESQ is absent.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-11

Major cleanup release: focus kudio into a lightweight, composable audio core.

### Added
- **Effects & augmentation** (`kudio.effects`): `trim_silence`,
  `split_on_silence`, `time_stretch`, `pitch_shift`, `gain`, `random_gain`,
  `add_noise_snr`, `reverb`, `spec_augment` (all seedable where random).
- **Dependency-free metrics**: `si_sdr`, `snr`, `segmental_snr`.
- **Exception hierarchy** rooted at `KudioError` (`AudioIOError`,
  `FeatureError`, `DeviceError`, `SynthesisError`, `DependencyError`).
- **`kudio` CLI**: `devices`, `info`, `convert`, `synth`, `trim`.
- `record()` (sounddevice backend), `map_waves()` parallel helper.
- `save_wave(..., subtype=...)` — 16/24-bit and float output via soundfile.
- `Synthesizer.syn(..., seed=...)` for reproducible synthesis.
- Docs scaffold (mkdocs + mkdocstrings) and GitHub Actions CI/publish workflow.

### Changed
- **Dependencies slimmed**: `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `openpyxl` moved to the
  `[viz]` / `[data]` extras. `import kudio` no longer pulls them.
- **Canonical API names** with deprecation-warning aliases (see README table);
  e.g. `w2s` → `waveform_to_spectrogram`.
- `file_load` reads via soundfile on the native-rate path (no librosa/numba).
- `KudioConfig` defaults trimmed to audio-only (training keys moved to chptrain).

### Removed
- Deprecated compatibility shims `_config.py`, `_enh/`, `version.py`,
  `util/others.py`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-11

First packaged release: extracted from the ckAudiux application into a
standalone, installable, MIT-licensed package.

### Added
- Core audio API: file I/O (`file_load`, `save_wave`, `check_input`),
  streaming/recording (`Recorder`, `LocalStreamReader`, `RemoteStreamReader`),
  thread-safe buffering (`AudioBuffer`, `FetchBuffer`).
- Feature extraction and spectrogram <-> waveform conversion (`w2s`,
  `spec2wavform`, `w2mfcc`, `wav2mel`, ...).
- Noisy-data synthesis (`Synthesizer`) and enhancement (`trad_enhance`,
  `wavelet_low_pass_filter`).
- Speech-quality evaluation (`AudioEvaluate`, `eval_metrics`: PESQ/STOI/SDR).
- Typed configuration (`KudioConfig`), `py.typed` marker.
- Optional extras: `audio` (PyAudio/sounddevice), `eval` (mir_eval/pystoi),
  `dev` (pytest). 57-test suite.

### Changed
- Modernized to librosa >= 0.10, numpy 2.x, pandas 2.x; replaced removed APIs
  (`np.fromstring`/`tostring`, `DataFrame.append`, `scipy.signal.hanning`,
  `librosa.waveplot`, ...).
- Rewrote `AudioBuffer` on `threading.Condition`/`deque` (was manipulating
  private `Semaphore._value`).
- Replaced `print` with the standard `logging` module; heavy dependencies
  (PyAudio) are now imported lazily.

### Removed
- Hidden AES license check that ran at import time (moved out of the package).
- Runtime `pip install` calls in the evaluation module.

### Fixed
- `check_path` sibling-increment logic, `Recorder.save` byte handling, and
  several latent shape/argument bugs.
